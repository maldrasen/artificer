# Artificer 0.1.0

Artificer is an incredibly perverse text-based game built using Electron. It combines elements of visual novel games, management sims, adventure games, and my own filthy imagination. Games like Corruption of Champions and Free Cities were my primary inspirations for the project. The game is a bit of a hybrid of the two with my own style mixed in.

Oh, and there are also furries, lots of furries.

Despite having around 25 thousand lines of code written as of this moment, the game is still in the very early stages of development. The executable can be built by cloning this repository and running the bin/build.sh script. Now, I don't think anyone other than myself has actually tried to do that so I have no idea if it will work for anyone else yet. If you do get the executable to build there are only about 10 minutes of gameplay implemented anyway.

Most of the work so far has been in getting the engine working, with all of the various database models, and game systems and so forth. New features are being added constantly. The first few days of in game time though required a lot of functionality to already be implemented, so for the time being adding new content will take a long time. The pace should pick up though as more features are complete. I'd like to have some kind of initial demo version complete sometime late 2020, or sometime in 2021. Difficult to estimate at the moment though.

## Helping Out

Artificer is an open source game, updatable and modifiable by anyone who would like to add their own content with their own fork, or by contributing to the main branch. If anyone at all is interested in helping out with the project I mostly artists and writers at this point, though mostly artists. This game is text based but there are still a lot of background images and character portraits and such that need drawn. I will need writers too though to create event scripts, as well as about a hundred different descriptions for assholes in various conditions.
