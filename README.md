Artificer is an incredibly perverse text-based game built using Electron. I'm currently working on a smaller prototype version of the core features of the main game. Eventually a more fully featured game will be built around this core. The planned features for Book 0 are:

1. An imp helps you to capture a sexual servant.
2. You train this servant over time to serve your sexual needs.
3. You are able to make incremental changes to their mind and body.
4. You will be able to build items, equipment, and furniture for your servant.

And although that doesn't sound like much, it's the core of the larger game that I have planned where all of these features have to be unlocked over time in a crafting / management / adventure style game. At least that's the plan. It will really depend on if there's any actual interest in a game like this.

## Helping Out

Artificer is an open source game, updatable and modifiable by anyone who would like to add their own content with their own fork, or by contributing to the main branch. If anyone at all is interested in helping out with the project I mostly artists and writers at this point.

## Links

I'm a bit scattered about at the moment. Sending me an email is probably the best way to contact me. I'm also maintaining a development blog, there's a subreddit for some reason and a couple tip jars as well. As far as tips are concerned, I don't really need any funding to continue development on this game. I'm retired, so it's my full-time hobby at this point. However if I do get tips I plan on using that money to purchase art assets, textures and such, and to commission artwork for the game.
