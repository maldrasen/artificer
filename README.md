Artificer will be an incredibly perverse text-based game built using Electron. Because of some of the changes made between Electron versions 8 and 10 I'm having to completely reengineer how the game's engine works for version 0.6. I also completely bit off more than I could chew with some of my initial goals for the project. I'm still working on the game, but it's going to have to be a much smaller, more manageable project than what I had planned earlier.

I won't have anything to show for quite a while again. I'll share more details once I have a better idea about what I'm even making here.
