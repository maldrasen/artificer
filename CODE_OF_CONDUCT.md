# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making
participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size,
disability, ethnicity, species, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

That said, this is an erotic, text based sex game with some freaky ass shit. No one under 18 will be allowed to
participate. Also, as the game will be written with a decidedly blasphemous outlook people with religious sensibilities
should probably look elsewhere.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Keeping it fun and sexy

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Slut shaming, kink shaming, or furry bashing
* Voting Republican, or being a Nazi.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take
appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits,
issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the
project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline
event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project lead at
maldrasen@gmail.com. He's a grouchy demonic dragon and will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that he deems appropriate to the circumstances. He is bound by ancient rites to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
