When we built a minion character we made these adjustments directly in the
character builder. Because these are scenario specific though, they should be
done here somewhere after the character is built. Perhaps the character
builder can send a message saying that a character was built, something can
watching for the message and pick up new characters, making these adjustments
to them?

if (Flag.lookup('player.goal') == 'followers') {
  await minion.update({ loyalty:(minion.loyalty + 10) });
}

if (minion.speciesCode == 'scaven') {
  if (Flag.lookup('player.scaven-reputations.the-butcher')) {
    await minion.update({ fear:(minion.fear + Random.between(5,10)) });
  }
  if (Flag.lookup('player.scaven-reputations.the-seductive')) {
    await minion.update({ loyalty:(minion.loyalty + Random.between(5,10)) });
  }
}
