=== Goals ===
When the game was started we adjusted the character's attributes based on the
player's current goal. This should still be done, but moved into the scenario's
player creation event.

if (options.goal == 'conquest')  { player.physical = player.physical + 10; }
if (options.goal == 'followers') { player.personal = player.personal + 10; }
if (options.goal == 'knowledge') { player.mental =   player.mental + 10; }
if (options.goal == 'power')     { player.magical =  player.magical + 10; }

Flag.setAll({ 'player.goal': options.goal });
