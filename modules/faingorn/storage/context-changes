So when an event is added we also added this minion data. These values were
used by the scrutinizer for various checks. However, because the duty and role
information is also included we don't want to add that to the character module.

When we add this back in it should be in it's own listener, subscribed to
"core.context.set-event"

We might still need generic minion data added by the character module to the
context, so perhaps the thing to do is move this role data under a different
context key, that or merge the two minionData objects together.

async addMinionData() {
  if (this.get('minionData') != null) { return; }

  const minions = await Character.findAll();

  let data = {
    totalCount: 0,
    freeCount: 0,
    missionCount: 0,
    workingCount: 0,
    taskCount: 0,
  }

  each(minions, minion => {
    data.totalCount++;
    if (minion.currentDuty == 'role') { data.freeCount++ }
    if (minion.currentDuty == 'mission') { data.missionCount++ }
    if (minion.currentDuty == 'project') { data.workingCount++ }
    if (minion.currentDuty == 'task') { data.taskCount++ }
  });

  this.set('minionData', data);
}
