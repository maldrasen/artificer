      { text:`I've decided to do something a little more practical for today's practice. I found a stone out in the
          courtyard, brought it into the Great Hall, and set it before me.` },
      { text:`It's a fairly large stone, about the size of a grapefruit and unusually round and smooth. Sitting on the
          floor, I again close my eyes and 'reach out' to the stone, examining it with nothing but my magical senses.` },
      { text:`Cool. Heavy. Solid. And although I carried it in here and know full well what it weighs, I feel like I
          can sense its weight as well.` },
      { text:`I open my eyes again and slowly lift it into the air, making it hover a foot or so off of the floor.` },
      { text:`What am I feeling when I'm doing this?` },
      { text:`I feel the rock, as much as I was when it was just sitting on the floor. Around the rock is a force. This
          force is formless though. It has no shape, no real presence.` },
      { text:`I'm creating the force, but it's not emanating from me, it simply is.` },
      { text:`It's pushing the rock up from below, but also pulling it up from above.` },
      { text:`Just holding it here takes effort, I find myself breathing harder. It feels like I'm holding a heavy
          weight out at arm's length, or perhaps even somewhat more difficult than that.` },
      { text:`I try lifting it higher.` },
      { text:`Lifting it, lowering it. Lifting it, lowering it.` },
      { text:`There's no burning sensation in my muscles but my heart rate is up, my breathing is heavy.` },
      { text:`Finally, I let the rock drop back down to the ground.` },
      { text:`I'm dripping with sweat.` },
      { text:`It would seem that doing something magically takes a bit more effort than it would take to do it
          physically.` },
      { text:`Nothing comes for free I suppose.` },
      { text:`Something within me is doing this, but this thing needs energy just like everything else, and for a
          biological creature like myself, that energy is food.` },
      { text:`Speaking of which, it's past time that I should make breakfast.` },
      { text:`I'll leave the rock here though for tomorrow's practice.` },
