      { text:`I've spent the last several days practicing moving rocks about. I feel like applying force is the
          simplest of magics, but as such it's something I want to be completely comfortable with.` },
      { text:`Picking up a rock with my mind should feel like second nature, something I ought to be able to do without
          even thinking about it.` },
      { text:`It's tiring, but I feel like my stamina is improving as well.` },
      { text:`When I first started practicing, lifting a rock magically took more effort than lifting one by hand. Now
          the opposite is true, though just barely.` },
      { text:`I don't think I'll be willing myself to fly about the battlements any time soon, but both my stamina and
          control are steadily improving.` },
      { text:`I wanted to branch out a bit this morning though.` },
      { text:`I know can make fire and light on demand. Doing so feels similar to using pure force, but in a way that's
          difficult to explain with words. It's like singing a song in a different key, except not at all like that.` },
      { text:`I concentrate on a space directly in front of me and produce a flame.` },
      { text:`Nothing big, just a flickering candle light.` },
      { text:`The trick though is keeping it sustained; burning, but fueled by nothing but willpower.` },
      { text:`It's not too difficult and something I could probably do indefinitely without growing overtired. I stoke
          the flame a bit, making it larger, brighter, hotter until I can feel the heat from it radiating against my
          face.` },
      { text:`This takes a bit more work. I'm sweating again, and not just from the heat of the flame.` },
      { text:`Finally, I let the fire die, stopping to catch my breath and to think.` },

      { text:`It's a strange sensation, I feel like I've learned something, but that's not true.` },
      { text:`I've remembered something.` },
      { text:`I know these forces. I understand their principles.` },
      { text:`&hellip;and through understanding comes mastery.` },
      { text:`I feel like I'm close to a breakthrough of some sort, I just need to keep at it.` },
