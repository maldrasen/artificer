              possible to get a complete panoramic view of the surrounding area from here.` },
      { text:`It's not exactly barren, not in the same way that a desert is at least. There is plant life, a few narrow
              trees and long stretches of tall spiky grass. It isn't what I would call thriving either though.` },
      { text:`It's a harsh land. A hard land. The constant cold winds that howl through the tower at night might have
              something to do with it, allowing only the strongest plants to survive. The keep and courtyard are
              sheltered from the biting winds. Standing out on this parapet though I feel cold, exposed, and utterly
              tiny.` },
      { text:`In the distance the land drops away sharply, disappearing into thick deciduous forests that surround this
              high rocky plateau. Beyond the forests though I can just barely make out a few signs of civilization.
              There are roads cut through the trees at the distant edge of the wood, and what might be farmland and a
              few small villages beyond that.` },
      { text:`As I look out into the far distance I am struck by an inexplicable anger. A sudden all consuming rage
              that would have me calling down fiery death upon those villages had I the strength.` },

      { text:`I close my eyes, breathing deeply. There are flashes, visions of something that isn't quite memory, or
              maybe memory from another person. Another life. Fire and blood. The sensation of drowning or suffocating.
              Cold steel cutting through my neck.` },

      { text:`It's hard to say. The perspective shifts back and forth in a way that makes it impossible to say one way
              or the other.` },
      { text:`Looking out over the seemingly placid landscape, all I can say for certain is that there's some history
              there between us. A history and a hatred.` },
      { text:`With a shudder that isn't just coming from the cold I make my way back inside. There is work to be
              done.` },
