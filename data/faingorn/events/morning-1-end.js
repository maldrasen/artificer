      { text:`The architecture here, from the way it was constructed to how it was decorated, it's unsettling. I
              wouldn't say that I was disturbed by it; it takes a lot to disturb me. It's just that the architecture
              here is&hellip; sexual, for lack of a better word.` },
      { text:`I can't imagine that it's normal for all of a building's ornamentation to be bondage and sadomasochism
              themed, but that's what we have here. From the statue in the courtyard alone one might assume that was
              once a cathedral of some ostentatious sex cult.` },
      { text:`But the keep doesn't have the layout of a church. It has the layout of a home.` },
      { text:`A grand home to be sure, with servant's quarters and other luxurious amenities, but this was once the
              home of a single family, or perhaps even one single incredibly perverse person. I haven't seen a room in
              this keep that doesn't have a dick carved into it somewhere after all.` },
      { text:`And when compared to all of the pierced and gaping assholes, overstuffed wide spread pussies, and bound
              and smashed tortured tits everywhere, the dicks almost seem pedestrian.` },
      { text:`No subject seems to have been taboo or off limits to the sculptor who made all of this. Torture,
              bestiality, scatophilia, are all well represented in the keep's ornamentation, with all three sometimes
              combined into a single work.` },
      { text:`It's all quite too much, though I have to assume that must be the point; that the too-muchness of it all
              is meant to overwhelm, disorient, and perhaps even disgust.` },
      { text:`And despite that, I find myself drawn to it. Well some of it at least.` },
      { text:`At one point, the keep must have been even more depraved and oppulant, back before anything that wasn't
              nailed down was scavenged away.` },

      { text:`I doesn't take much longer to finish my crude fur clothing. The rest of the day is spent cleaning up the
              hall as well as I'm able, magically floating the larger piles of animal waste out into the courtyard.
              Which is followed of course by a good foot washing in the keep's central bath.` },
