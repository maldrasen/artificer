      <div class='page after-gender-page'>With that form in mind I will myself to again be made flesh.</div>
      <div class='page'>It's impossible to say how long it takes.</div>
      <div class='page'>It could be minutes or years.</div>
      <div class='page'>Time has no meaning here after all, wherever it is that here is.</div>
      <div class='page'>Before I can really determine the nature of this place, this void between life and death, I am awoken by the feeling of grass under my back.</div>
      <div class='page' data-set-background="../../data/artificer/client/images/bg-field-1.png">I bolt upright. I still feel sluggish, like I've just woken up after a long sleep.</div>
      <div class='page'>I'm standing in some sort of field.</div>
      <div class='page'>The barren landscape is cold and windy, and I'm completely naked.</div>
      <div class='page'>I need to find shelter before I freeze to death and have to reform myself yet again.</div>
      <div class='page'>And so I wander, looking for any signs of civilization.</div>
      <div class='page'>...</div>
      <div class='page'>After some time I come across a road.</div>
      <div class='page'>It's in bad repair and doesn't look like it's been traveled upon for some time.</div>
      <div class='page'>Still, it's better than nothing; so I follow it.</div>
      <div class='page' data-set-background="../../data/artificer/client/images/bg-field-2.png">...</div>
      <div class='page'>This land is unusually empty.</div>
      <div class='page'>I don't remember it, or any place else for that matter, so I can't say whether or not that's to be expected.</div>
      <div class='page'>There must be people somewhere though.</div>
      <div class='page'>Someone built this road after all.</div>
      <div class='page' data-set-background="../../data/artificer/client/images/bg-keep-distant.png">...</div>
      <div class='page'>After what feels like hours of walking I finally find some further evidence of civilization; an abandoned looking keep, set upon a high and rocky hill.</div>
      <div class='page'>Even from this distance I can see that its high walls and single tall tower are crumbling, practically near collapse.</div>
      <div class='page'>There is a chance though that I could find something useful in such a place.</div>
      <div class='page'>At the very least it will provide some shelter against the cold winds of these barren hinterlands.</div>
      <div class='page'>...</div>
      <div class='page'>I walk around the rocky hill to the keep's front entrance.</div>
      <div class='page'>The keep's massive oak doors lie in a pile of rubble near the entryway.</div>
      <div class='page'>Whatever fate befell this place was a violent one.</div>
      <div class='page' data-set-background="../../data/artificer/client/images/bg-courtyard-ruined.png">...</div>
      <div class='page'>The keep's central courtyard lies in ruins.</div>
      <div class='page'>Piles of rubble and debris block the entrance to the keep's main hall.</div>
      <div class='page'>It will grow dark soon, so spending what daylight remains making a rudimentary camp seems like the best course of action.</div>
      <div class='page'>I gather sticks and stones from around the courtyard and fashion a small fire pit.</div>
      <div class='page'>Almost without thought I set the fire ablaze with a quick gesture.</div>
      <div class='page'>I realize with a start what just happened and stare at my hand in some small wonder.</div>
      <div class='page'>I'm a wizard then?</div>
      <div class='page'>Able to call forth elemental fire from nothing?</div>
      <div class='page'>It was instinctive; like something I've done countless times before, but could only recall just now being able to do such a thing.</div>
      <div class='page'>And it makes me wonder of course what other powers are at my disposal?</div>
      <div class='page'>With my campfire burning brightly before me, I sit and contemplate such things.</div>

      <div class='page'>There's a creature of some sort nearby.</div>
      <div class='page'>I bolt upright and let off a flash of bright light that illuminates the entire courtyard in a harsh white glare.</div>
      <div class='page'>I'm surrounded by small rat-like creatures.</div>
      <div class='page'>Well, surrounded is not quite the right word...</div>
      <div class='page'>What rats haven't scurried off cower away from me, clearly terrified that I might incinerate or otherwise magically mangle them in some way.</div>
      <div class='page'>The rats have a fairly humanoid shape, though their faces remain very rat-like, with short muzzles and twitching whiskers.</div>

      <div class='page'>
        <span class='select' data-show-if='config.metric'>They're a little over a meter tall or so,</span>
        <span class='select' data-show-if-not='config.metric'>They range from about three to four feet tall,</span>
        and their bodies are covered in thick brown and black fur and wear clothing made from various animal hides.

      <div class='page'>The boldest of these rats crawls towards me.</div>
      <div class='page'><span class='minion-quote'>"No! No! Don't kill! Please."</span></div>

      <div class='page'>You consider his words for a moment.</div>
      <div class='page'>Having some minions, even ones as meager as these, would be useful.</div>
      <div class='page'>You could use them to explore this keep at the very least; first establish a foothold then decide what to do from there.</div>

      <div class='page'>
        You nod to the rats gathered around you and say, <span class='player-quote'>"Very well. I will make you my
        minions. You may call me <span class='title-fill'></span>"</span>
