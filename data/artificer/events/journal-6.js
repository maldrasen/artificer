      { text:`Out of curiosity I flip through the pages of Malcolm's journal.` },
      { text:`Disappointingly, there are only a couple dozen entries left.` },
      { text:`The rest of the book contains nothing but empty pages.` },
      { text:`It would seem I'm quickly approaching the end of his tale.` },
      { text:`He is writing less often though, with each entry covering a longer time period.` },
      { text:`Without a way to decipher the carvings, and with Wren having returned to Dennevar, Malcolm took over the
              work of maintaining and improving their home.` },
      { text:`Throughout the winter he worked at the forge or the loom, crafting rugs and candle sconces, really
              anything to make the keep a more comfortable place to live.` },
      { text:`Wren however is absent for an unusually long time, and it's well into spring by the time she returns.` },
      { text:`In the end she was unable to find anything that would even be remotely helpful in deciphering the carvings.` },
      { text:`There were no references, no other examples, no one who had any more knowledge than they had.` },
      { text:`There were rumors though; of places down in the deep, below even the kingdoms of the Goblins and the
              Dark Elves, where strange unknowable symbols could be found.` },
      { text:`Rumors were less than what they had now though, and if anything they were now the foremost authority on these writings.` },
      { text:`She did however return with something useful.` },
      { text:`Or someone rather.` },
      { text:`Caspar Gamblegold, a gnomish artificer.` },
      { text:`The artificers are master craftsmen who specialize in the creation of magical artifacts.` },
      { text:`The conundrum of the bottomless well piqued his interest.` },
      { text:`Artificers love nothing more than a seemingly unsolvable problem, and then of course crafting a solution for it.` },
      { text:`His plan was to construct a craft of some sort here on site that would be capable of making the journey.` },
      { text:`He brought wagons with him, with all the materials and tools he could conceivably need.` },
      { text:`Which is curious as I haven't seen any such wagons or even remains of wagons.` },
      { text:`He began work immediately but it would be weeks before he finished.` },
      { text:`In that time Malcolm and Wren completed their work on the keep, having made it as comfortable and
              livable as possible with the tools and materials they had at their disposal.` },
      { text:`Finally on the Day of the Toad, Summer, Year of The Bloody Fox, in the 13th Age, just over a year after
              their arrival, they were prepared to descend into the well.` },
      { text:`Gamblegold had built what he called a drop ship.` },
      { text:`Malcolm found it's shape rather embarrassing, but given that the craft was primarily a tube filled with
              crystal mana cells, it's long phallic shape was unavoidable.` },
      { text:`The plan was that once they were all onboard, they would simply drop the craft down into The Well.` },
      { text:`As soon as they saw the bottom they would engage the mana cells, decelerating the craft to a manageable slow fall, allowing them to safely land.` },
      { text:`Slowing from the decent should only take about 10% of the mana that they're bringing with them, allowing the rest to be used for the return trip.` },
      { text:`Surprisingly Gamblegold wasn't much of a risk taker, preferring wide margins of error when journeying into the unknown.` },
      { text:`Then, with everything well prepared and every eventuality planned for, they descended into The Well.` },
      { text:`And it's there that the journal comes to an end.` },
      { text:`They never made it back.` },
      { text:`...` },
      { text:`What's more, nothing had happened to the keep.` },
      { text:`No disaster at least, other than weather, an infestation of rats, and a half century of time.` },
      { text:`Sighing I set the book aside.` },
      { text:`Nothing but enigmas and mysteries; not a single answer.` },
      { text:`The Well.` },
      { text:`The Inscriptions.` },
      { text:`The Abominations.` },
      { text:`Hell, even the purpose of this keep.` },
      { text:`Well, such things will have to wait I suppose.` },
      { text:`Survival is all that matters now.` },
      { text:`Clothing.` },
      { text:`Food.` },
      { text:`Shelter.` },
      { text:`Once these things are fully taken care of I can worry about long dead mysteries.` },
