// // === Snake Cocks ===
// // Only the Naga naturally have snake cocks, and they are all built having two cocks, so it's safe to assume that most
// // characters with snake cocks will have more than one. Players may change their cock shapes to snake and may have one
// // or many cocks, but they will only get the universal cock descriptions then, rather then the snake focuses ones.
