I'm going to periodically update this file, perhaps weekly or so with the LOC
stats, just to keep a running total. Then I can just look through the git
versions of this file to see the history, growth rate etc. I know, LOC is a
terrible measure of progress and doneness normally, but this project involves a
ton of writing, so knowing how many lines this has is actually useful. I'm
thinking once we approach 500,000 lines we'll be close to done.
