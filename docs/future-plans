=== Pregnancy Content ===

Support for pregnancies. Character's should first only be able to get pregnant naturally. For Kobolds that means having
an egg to lay. Pregnant characters get larger breasts and more prominent nipples depending on how far along they are.
Different species have different gestation times. Rats only take three weeks for an entire pregnancy. Eventually, with
the right upgrades, characters will be able to get pregnant cross-species, then get pregnant from animals. Will add
upgrades for pregnancy speeds and extra fertility. With the addition of pregnancy we'll also include all kinds of
abortion fetish content to the demon's demands on the player, just to ensure of course that we piss everyone off.

There is some sort of curse upon the land though that children cannot actually be born. A full term normal pregnancy
will only result in a soulless twisted abomination that if allowed to live will only turn into a monster of some sort.

=== More Body Mods ===

I'd like to include support for tattoos and piercings at some point.
