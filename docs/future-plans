=== Pregnancy Content ===

Support for pregnancies. Character's should first only be able to get pregnant naturally. For Kobolds that means having
an egg to lay. Pregnant characters get larger breasts and more prominent nipples depending on how far along they are.
Different species have different gestation times. Rats only take three weeks for an entire pregnancy. Eventually, with
the right upgrades, characters will be able to get pregnant cross-species, then get pregnant from animals. Will add
upgrades for pregnancy speeds and extra fertility. With the addition of pregnancy we'll also include all kinds of
abortion fetish content to the demon's demands on the player, just to ensure of course that we piss everyone off.

There is some sort of curse upon the land though that children cannot actually be born. A full term normal pregnancy
will only result in a soulless twisted abomination that if allowed to live will only turn into a monster of some sort.

I think we should treat pregnancy like any other injury. Getting pregnant follows the same path. That way a hazard can
also get a character pregnant. Pregnant should have a pregnancy type and counter at the very least, probably a father
attribute as well.

=== More Body Mods ===

I'd like to include support for tattoos and piercings at some point.

=== Anal Tongues ===

As a possible mutation, a character can grow a tongue rooted somewhere in their anus. Tongue should have a length
attribute.

=== Backlog? ===

In case you click past some important text we should keep a running text backlog on the client side. In order to do
this, I think I need to copy the rendered text out of every page as it's viewed. This could be tricky though, and I'd
have to be sure to skip hidden text, or ensure that it stays hidden. Also styles would need to be copied.

=== Pussy Changes ===

I think I need to make some changes on how both pussies and asses are
implemented. We currently have the pussy condition, size, and scale, but I'm
thinking I'm going to want events where we slowly stretch a pussy out. I
think there first off needs to be a damage attribute. Which shows bruising,
tearing, and other evidence of abuse. There should be a streching progress,
attribute that tracks how far we are from changing the condition. For some
reason size doesn't take condition into consideration? Not sure if size
should stay static and condition becomes a multiplier or if size increases
with condition? Stretching progress should add to size too though. So maybe
progress is measured in mm, and once mm meets the next size threshold it
changes? Progress drops over time though until the threshold is passed. I
want to change labia lengths too. I should give outer and innter labia both
a natural value of 1-3. Beyond that is unnatural growth that you cause
somehow. Anus needs more shapes too, small, slightly protruding, wide and
wrinkled, etc.

=== Threshold Events ===

I think there needs to be something that checks all of the minions at the end
of the day to check if certain thresholds have been met and to set events
accordingly. This could be used for all sorts of things like running low on
food events and that sort of thing. We could also use it to unlock unexpected
paths. Like the first time you get a lactating minion with giant tits you can
turn them into a cow, or at least that path is unlocked.
