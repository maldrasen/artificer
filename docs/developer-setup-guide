===============================
Development Setup - For Windows
===============================

1. Install Node
  Currently using v10.16.3

2. Install Build Tools

  (windows-build-tools has to be run as Administrator from CMD or PowerShell)
  $ npm install --global --production windows-build-tools

  $ npm install --global node-gyp

3. Install Sqlite3 using this script.

  $ bin/install-sqlite.sh

4. Compile Assets

  The assets are compiled by calling either of the style scripts, which are
  just shorthand for the more complicated sass commands.
  $ bin/compile_style.sh
  $ bin/watch_style.sh
