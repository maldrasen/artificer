Windows Development Setup
=========================
1. Install Node (v 12.14.0)

2. Install Yarn (v 1.21.1)

3. Install Build Tools

  (windows-build-tools has to be run as Administrator from CMD or PowerShell)
  $ npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
  $ npm install --global node-gyp



Still actually figuring all this out now that we've switched to yarn. Everything
seems to just work though?
