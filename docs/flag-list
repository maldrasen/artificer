=== Automatic ===
enqueued.{code}    | {count} The number of times this event has been enqueued | Every event that has been enqueued by the
                     game will get this flag set. It's primarily used to prevent non-repeatable events, but can also be
                     used to see if an event has been executed and how many times.
