=== Automatic ===
enqueued.{code}    {count} The number of times this event has been enqueued | Every event that has been enqueued by the
                   game will get this flag set. It's primarily used to prevent non-repeatable events, but can also be
                   used to see if an event has been executed and how many times.

completed.{code}   {count} The number of times this event has been completed. Because sometimes you need to know if an
                   event has been completed, not that it's been enqueued. Primarily for location events that can be
                   enqueued without being done yet.

map.{code}         {unlocked} For a location to appear on the map, the map.{code} flag needs to be set to 'unlocked'
