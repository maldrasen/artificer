Oof. Took a 4 month break because I just couldn't. And now I'm back and it seems I've got to completely redo the engine from scratch. Huge delay in progress. It's not a complete disaster. I'll be able to save most of what I have, though it will still mean rewriting most, if not all of it.

So let's address a few of the big issues:

  1. The module system wasn't working. We had a couple of modules, but they were still not really modular. Everything was still too tightly coupled and couldn't be isolated.

  2. The sex system was still a mess. This should be the heart of the game after all, all of the adventure stuff is just the wrapper around getting to the fucking. I need to refocus my direction on making a sex system that works, then building the game around it. If everything is properly modular I should be able to make the fucking game, then add everything plot centric onto it afterwards.

So I think that's essentially the plan. It's not just a copy paste job any more from the previous version. In order to decouple things into modules I'm going to need something like postal talking to a central controller. I want to remove the electron stuff from the core as well. That way starting the specs isn't different from how we start the main game.
