=== Selection Pages ===
Selection Pages are for normal multiple choice options in an event. The selectionKey will be set on the event options
object to value of the selected choice.
  - The text in each selection is interpolated by the weaver in the engine when the event is prepared.
  - The selections can have adjustment badges which can be displayed on the selection.

  - example:
      {
        selectionPage: true,
        selectionKey: 'approach',
        selections:[
          { text:'Suck {{R::gender.his}} cock.', value:'befriend', effects:['player oral 1']},
          { text:'Fist {{R::gender.his}} ass.', value:'torment',   effects:['player fisting 2']},
        ]
      }

The adjustment badges are built from a space seperated string. The adjustment strang is made up of three elements; the
subject, the aspect, and the level.

  Subject: This is the actor, or group of actors getting adjusted. Normally a character being adjusted will be in the
           weaver context so we look there first. If the subject isn't in the actors list, we send it as is, and the
           CharacterAgent figures out who we're talking about.

  Aspect:  The Aspect being adjusted. This should either map to an attribute like fear or loyalty, to an aspect like
           golden, or to something player specific, like rat-fucker. Whatever string is used it will need to be
           understood by the AspectAdjuster.

  Level:   The level of the adjustment, -3 to 3, but not 0.
