The training phase is the next major feature that I'm planning on adding to the game. I was planning on unlocking the phase after the bath event, but I think that's a bit arbitrary. It makes more sense to unlock the ability to assign a minion to your bed after you have soap, but unlock training after the fruit-and-nuts event. If you have sex with your minion obviously you'll want to make it a regular thing. If you don't I think you can still choose to train your minions in non-sexual ways too.

The more I think about this though, training doesn't seem like a simple list of tasks, or rather there's a lot of overlap between tasks. I think you'll need to choose an overall training type, then select elements of training to add into that. Or rather different training types have a variety of options. At first you can only train one minion a night. That will expand to multiple minions later in the game though. So the process here is to first select a minion, then a training type.

Training Row:
  Minion:(minion) TypeTabs:[ Physical | Mental | Sexual | Platonic ]

  Physical
    Strength | Fighting

  Mental
    (nothing yet)

  Sexual
    Punish | Reward (builds fear or loyalty)
    Focus:
      [] Anal
      [] Oral  
      [] Vag
      [] Cock
      [] Golden (unlocked later)
      [] Stretching (unlocked later)

And really all of this needs to replace summoning entirely. There's too much overlap there. All of the story teller stuff still completely applies though. The consent calculator also fits into this as well because you can only reward with sex that a minion consents to. Punish training can be done at any time, but in addition to increasing fear, there are negative penalties for punishing minions, especially if you do it too often.

I think this is a good place to start though.
